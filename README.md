### Idea

A place for creators to share their Indie stories and journey, as well as what they're working on.

### Why?

Everyone has a story, yet no one shares it. Talking to so many creators, and people I've learned that you have a story. There should be a way to express your thoughts/stories without having to be interviewed. There would be no need for anything if it did not exist.

### How will it be?

The Idea is to allow people to

-   Create their profile page
-   Share their Story
-   Make a custom page

The idea is to allow them to make multiple pages, and have one profile. The profile will have a mini-story section, and some other stuff.

### How is Maker stories different?

Polywork and Indie hackers are nice yet, they don't have the fit for Indie Stories. I love what they're both doing, and neither am I making a whole new platform just to compete with them.

I want to offer, different features

-   Profile Pages (/arav, /ayush, /ishan)

Profile pages are the main idea. We want to let creators make their own profile, Profile should be

-   Image of person or avatar
-   Bio of them
-   Project list (no icons, no images)
-   Story section (share)

More featurtes, will be added affter building the main project and getting ideas

-   Pages( /arav/about, /ayush/projects)

Create your own Story page or content page. A self-hosted bio page? A proejct showcase? A theme. Whatever you want.

The pages idea is still in idea. I'm thinking of letting people to make pages

-   Discover Pages/projects

We can start a newsletter, or feature someone's profile on the homepage, or discover page to show what they're working on.

-   Interviews

Person can intevriew themself, we will have Copyai to write sample questions.

## Ideas we have

-   Pages
-   Twitter/Product Embed
-   Embeds like polywork, not the same way
-   Share profiles or videos (to much like [lu.ma](http://lu.ma))
-   Allow custom pages, movable, a website builder kinda, Possible with Remake
